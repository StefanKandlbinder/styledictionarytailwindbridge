# Styledictionarytailwindbridge

A Bridge between [Amazons Styledictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/ "Amazons Styledictionary Tokens Build System") Tokens Build System and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Introduction
Wouldn't it be nice to inject your [Amazon Styledictionary Custom Properties](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/formats?id=cssvariables) to your [tailwind.config.js](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme#customizing-the-default-theme)?

## The Bridge
You can find more informations about the process of converting the style dictionary tokens to custom tailwind formats inside the [styledictionary tailwind formats](https://github.com/StefanKandlbinder/styledictionarytailwindbridge/tree/main/src/styledictionary/formats) section.

## The Documentation
To show the final outcome, i created a little Angular/TailwindCSS App based on the generated tokens.
This demo is hosted under the pseudonym [Stylewind](https://stylewind.netlify.app/) on Netlify(https://www.netlify.com/).
